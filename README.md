# Twitter Search Application

The Twitter Search application aims to design and develop a search engine that retrieves relevant tweets or users based on user queries. It processes large amounts of Twitter data to extract information and has a search interface that allows users to easily query the data. The primary goal of the application is to be robust and user-friendly.The scope of the project includes designing and implementing a data model to store user and tweet information, optimizing data storage and retrieval using appropriate datastores, and designing a search interface to allow users to search for tweets based on keywords, hashtags, or usernames. The project also involves optimizing the search process for speed and efficiency and implementing caching mechanisms to improve performance.Overall, this project aims to provide a powerful tool for searching and analyzing Twitter data, which can be useful for a variety of applications, including social media marketing, sentiment analysis, and research.

## Dataset:

The dataset used for the Twitter Search application project consists of tweets collected from the Twitter API. The dataset includes information on individual tweets, including the tweet text, date and time of posting, user information, and associated metadata such as hashtags and mentions. The dataset also includes information on the users who posted the tweets, such as their usernames, follower and following counts, and profile descriptions. The dataset contains 88068 users, 50915 tweets, and 61108 retweets. Due to the sheer size of the dataset, it is important to develop efficient methods for storing and searching through the data to extract useful insights.

## Steps to run the search application:

  1. Import necessary libraries and set up MySQL and MongoDB
  2. Run the twitter dataset processing file
  3. Run the search app with correct authentication to the datastores.
